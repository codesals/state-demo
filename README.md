# useState class demo - Instructor notes:

- Start with blank counter app, with placeholder button and blank functions (in _App.js_)
- Demonstrate updating counter using `counter++` and `console.log`
- Rewrite the code with `useState` to demonstrate the dynamic re-render
- Try `useState` in an `if` condition, for example, to demonstrate error
- Refer to "_final.js_" for the functioning useState code (Component name: _State_)
